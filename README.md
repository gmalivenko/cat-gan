# Cat GAN

This is the GAN implementation of cats generator. 

What is the GAN? Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)). So, it means that we should train 2 networks with different architectures and in different ways.

## Architecture

### Generator

The generator has very custom but straightforward architecure.
ConvTranspose2d -> SELU -> [ConvTranspose2d -> SELU] x N -> ConvTranspose2d -> Tanh

### Discriminator

A ResNet-18 with single-neuron output seems capatible for this project.

The generator has very custom but straightforward architecure.
ConvTranspose2d -> SELU -> [ConvTranspose2d -> SELU] x N -> ConvTranspose2d -> Tanh

## Examples

The output on 5k iteration (for default configuration):

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the PyTorch installation, please follow [this guide](http://pytorch.org)

## Training
To run the training script, make changes in the configuration (example is config/train.yml).

```
python train.py --config config/train.yml
```
